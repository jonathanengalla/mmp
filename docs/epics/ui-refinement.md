# Epic: UI-Refinement

## Objective
Standardize UI primitives (tables, typography) and align data contracts so admin/member experiences are consistent, accessible, and match the stabilized backend.

## Scope
- Shared table/typography primitives adoption
- Admin visibility and RBAC-aligned UI states
- Finance/events contract alignment
- Checkout/empty/error states polish
- Contrast/heading consistency

## Stories
- UIR-01 — Shared table component rollout
- UIR-02 — Global typography token adoption
- UIR-03 — Finance dashboard data contract alignment
- UIR-04 — Events checkout UX and error states
- UIR-05 — Admin visibility and role-guarded UI
- UIR-06 — Heading/contrast accessibility pass

## Dependencies/Notes
- Depends on Backend-Stabilization contracts (invoice/event fields, roles).
- Should follow Theme-Engine token sweep to avoid rework.
